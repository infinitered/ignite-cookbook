### What's the Ignite Cookbook for React Native all about?

**Spin Up Your App In Record Time**

> Stop reinventing the wheel on every project. Use the Ignite CLI to get your app started. Then, hop over to the Ignite Cookbook for React Native to browse for things like libraries in “cookie cutter” templates that work for almost any project. It’s the fastest way to get a React Native app off the ground.

**Find Quality Code When You Need It**

> The popular forum sites are great for finding code until you realize it’s based on an old version of React Native. Ignite Cookbook is a place for recipes that work as of the time they’re published – meaning, it worked when it was posted. And if it ever goes out of date, we’ll make sure the community knows on what version it was last working.

**Backed By A Community Of React Native Experts**

> The Ignite Cookbook isn’t just a random group of code snippets. It’s a curated collection of usable code samples that the Infinite Red team’s used in their own React Native projects. Having worked with some of the biggest clients in the tech industry, we know a thing or two about keeping our code to a high standard. You can code confidently!
