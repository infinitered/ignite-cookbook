# Theming Ignite

## Using `Unistyles`

The ignite boilerplate comes with a powerful generic theming system that you can adapt to fit the needs of your own app by replacing colors and fonts using the built-in theme files.

We recognize that many people like using pre-built components and design systems such as styled-components, emotion, and unistyles.

styled-components is a popular library for react and react-native that

:::warning

Unistyles includes custom native code, which means it does not support Expo Go. You'll need to use expo CNG to build your app.

To do this with an newly ignited app, run `yarn expo prebuild --clean` and then `yarn start`.

:::

### 1. Add `react-native-unistyles to your app:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">yarn add react-native-unistyles</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">npm install react-native-unistyles</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">pnpm install react-native-unistyles</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Add define Unistyles theme types:

Create a new file in you Ignited app's `types` folder called `react-native-unistyles.d.ts` with the following content:

```tsx
// Override UnistylesThemes to get accurate typings for your project.
import type { Theme } from "app/theme";

type AppThemes = {
  light: Theme;
  dark: Theme;
};

declare module "react-native-unistyles" {
  export interface UnistylesThemes extends AppThemes {}
}
```

### 3. Configure unistyles to use the app's Theme:

Add the following to your app's `app/App.tsx`:

```diff
+import { UnistylesRegistry } from "react-native-unistyles"
+import { darkTheme, lightTheme } from "app/theme"

SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()

+UnistylesRegistry.addThemes({
+  light: lightTheme,
+  dark: darkTheme,
+}).addConfig({
+  // adaptiveThemes: true,
+  initialTheme: "light",
+})
+

function IgniteApp() {
  return <App hideSplashScreen={SplashScreen.hideAsync} />
}
```

### 4. Ensure that Unistyles knows when we want to change the theme:

Open the `app/utils/useAppTheme.ts` and make the following changes:

```diff
  const setThemeContextOverride = useCallback((newTheme: ThemeContexts) => {
    setTheme(newTheme)
+    UnistylesRuntime.setTheme(newTheme || "light")
  }, [])
```

### 5. Create and use your first Unistyles component using the new theme:

```tsx
import { createStyleSheet, useStyles } from "react-native-unistyles";

export const MyScreen = (props) => {
  const { styles } = useStyles($uniStyles);
  return (
    <Text style={styles.text}>
      This text color and background will change when changing themes.
    </Text>
  );
};

const $uniStyles = createStyleSheet((theme) => ({
  text: {
    color: theme.colors.text,
    backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
  },
}));
```

## Complete!

You can now use Unistyles integrated into the Ignite theme engine. To swap themes provide the user a switch or toggle button:

```tsx
const { setThemeContextOverride, themeContext } = useAppTheme();

return (
  <Button
    onPress={() => {
      LayoutAnimation.configureNext(LayoutAnimation.Presets.easeInEaseOut); // Animate the transition
      setThemeContextOverride(themeContext === "dark" ? "light" : "dark");
    }}
    text={`Switch Theme: ${themeContext}`}
  />
);
```
